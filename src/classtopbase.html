                    ClassTopBase is a school management software for after-schools. It allows schools to manage their students, classes, teacher. I joined the team last year as the solo product designer. I have done quite few things for the past year, I will only pick two
                    things to talk about. You can jump to the section by clicking the link below.

              Dashboard Design
            </h2>
            <p>
              As our team add more features to ClassTopBase, dashboard is the natural thing we
              started to think about developing next. I have to admit that we
              don’t know how useful dashboard will be the users, but since it’s
              relatively easy to develop, we figured to do it first and see how
              it works. The process for developing dashboard as the following.
              Brain storming, card sorting, wireframe, design, build, test,
              go live.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-lg mt-16 mb-2">Brain Storming</h3>
            <p>
              Me and my product team sit together. We listed everything
              ClassTopBase does on sticky notes, and separate them into three
              categories. Features, Navigations and Metrics.
            </p>

                      I forgot to document this process, here is a visual

            <h3 class="text-lg mt-16 mb-2">Card Sorting</h3>
            <p>
              Then we draw a big triangle on a white board as the basic shape of
              dashboard. We then place all the sticky notes onto the triangle
              based on where we think they belong. During this process, I will
              challenge the team, including me, the placement of each sticky
              note. Whether they are useful to users or not. There were a lot of
              back and forth, debating what should be on dashboard and where
              should it be. From doing this, we will get a general wireframe for
              the dashboard.

              The brain storming and card sorting exercise were really helpful.
              However, the outcome is still too complex. So I took my time and
              nail down five things to show on dashboard.

            <p>
              The old navigation is not particular easy to use. The main
              category and the sub category are separate from each other. It
              requires users to move mouse quite far. With more features we
              have, we need to do a redesign of the navigation. We were also not
              happy with old UI design. They are not polished, but because the
              team were rush to build the product, UI are not consistent through
              out the product. So I was tasked to redesign the navigation and
              UI.

                    Users can also see what's in other channerls without navigate to
                    that channel.

              I chose a popular design pattern for the navigation. Put every link to the left and let user click through it. People have seen this kind of navigation before, so it’s easy for them to pick up and it can include all of our features. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I was choosing to use a darker background for the navigation or a lighter one. I eventually decided on a darker color, because it has better separation between the navigation and main content.

              I first let user click through the navigation. Once developer finished building the navigation, I was messing around with CSS and try to find better ways to use the navigation. I tried to let user hover on the navigation to expend the sub-categories. Although I like hover on things myself, it is not super user friendly, it can be easily triggered to a different state. So eventually I went back on the old click.  
            </p>
            <p>When I was doing the UI overhaul, I chose the blue color we had in the old design as the brand color. Blue used a lot in SaaS product and bank because people think blue means safe and security. We want to convey the same idea. I adjust that blue to a dark grade to be AA compliant defined by WCAG 2.0 guidelines for contrast accessibility. </p>

            <p>I go straight into css and start changing things. Because it’s faster for me to tried different things and see it on the actual things. However, later after I finished everything, I realized that’s was not the best idea. Although, I saved sometimes on design the UIs, if I want to collate with other designer, I will have problem. It’s fine for now, because I am the only designer. And most things in the app are build on component, so when we make new features, I don’t have to design them for developers to see. </p>
